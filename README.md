# Python Projects
Example projects and code snippets using Python and PyMongo to interact with MongoDB

Each folder will comprise a single, individual project that can be tested and run on its own. Some projects will be more complex than others, but, the idea is to show how the MongoDB API works in Python 2.7.x and how useful and reliable Python can be to develop simple web applications.

This README will be updated as new projects and/or files are developed. These applications were all developed with the experienced gained in MongoDB University courses.
